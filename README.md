If you want to execute this notebook on your jupyter locally, navigate to the repository and enter 
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
Then, simply open the imdb_bert.ipynb with your jupyter notebook.

Due to the long duration that the model takes to train, its weights are saved in the imdb_bert.h5 file. You won't have to wait one hour for the model to finish training ;)

Have fun
